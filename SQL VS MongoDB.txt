SQL VS MongoDB
Comparing between SQL to MongoDB
Onyinyechi Julius-Okorie


Introduction to SQL Databases
Title: Introduction to SQL Databases
Content:
Definition: SQL databases are relational databases that use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data.
Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, SQL Server.
Structure: Data is stored in tables with predefined schemas.
Use Cases: Best suited for applications requiring complex queries, multi-row transactions, and structured data.


Performance and Scalability
Title: Performance and Scalability
Content:
SQL:
Vertical Scalability: Typically scaled by increasing the hardware (CPU, RAM) of the existing server.
Performance: Optimized for complex transactions and multi-table operations.
Consistency: Strong consistency due to ACID compliance.
MongoDB:
Horizontal Scalability: Designed for horizontal scaling by adding more servers (sharding).
Performance: Excellent for large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data and real-time applications.
Flexibility: Easily handles changes in data structures and large-scale, distributed data.


Introduction to MongoDB (NoSQL)
Title: Introduction to MongoDB (NoSQL)
Content:
Definition: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents rather than tables.
Document-Oriented: Each document can have a different structure, allowing for more flexibility.
Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB, Cassandra (other types of NoSQL databases).
Use Cases: Ideal for unstructured data, hierarchical data storage, and applications requiring high flexibility and scalability.


Data Model and Structure
Title: Data Model and Structure Comparison
Content:
SQL:
Schema-Based: Requires a predefined schema where tables are created with specific columns and data types.
ACID Compliance: Supports transactions ensuring atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.
Relationships: Enforces strict relationships using foreign keys.
MongoDB:
Schema-Less: No need for a predefined schema; documents can vary in structure.
Eventual Consistency: Prioritizes availability and partition tolerance (CAP theorem).
Embedded Documents: Relationships can be embedded within a single document or referenced between documents.


Query Language and Operations
Title: Query Language and Operations
Content:
SQL:
Query Language: Uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and manipulating data.
Complex Queries: Supports complex joins, aggregations, and nested queries.
Standardization: SQL is standardized across different relational databases, though slight variations exist.
MongoDB:
Query Language: Uses a JSON-like query language, allowing for powerful and flexible queries.
Aggregation Framework: Supports complex data aggregation operations.
Sharding: Built-in support for horizontal scaling (sharding).
